 2. Acknowledgements
 
 I am grateful to Peter van der Linden for making available his t.java FTP client class.
 I have not copied this class but have drawn heavily on its ideas. Make sure you visit
 his excellent Java FAQ, at http://www.afu.com/javafaq.html.

 I am also grateful to the very many people who have sent in suggestions, comments and bug fixes.
